            Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sarah, a multidisciplinary developer and designer, specialized in creating complex and data-heavy products that are accessible, ethical and user friendly. I also enjoy making <a href="https://codepen.io/fossheim/collections/">art with CSS</a>.
            On here, I frequently write about HTML/CSS, React, Python, UX design, accessibility and data visualizations.
